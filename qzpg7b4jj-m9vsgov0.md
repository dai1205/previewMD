### **Step 1: Set the Date & Time (Based on Cat Personality)**

| **Cat Type** | **Ideal Time** | **Duration** |  
|--------------|----------------|--------------|  
| Social Butterflies | Weekend Afternoons | 2 hours |  
| Shy Cats | Quiet Weekday Mornings | 30 minutes |

**Pro Tip**: Sync with your cat’s “zoomies” time for peak playfulness.

### **Step 2: Choose a Theme (With Safety in Mind)**

**2024’s Top 3 Themes** (All Using Non-Toxic Materials):  
1. **Under the Meow-n**: Glow-in-the-dark stars (stickers only), cosmic tuna cake  
2. **Jungle Safari**: Cardboard box “jeep”, plush prey filled with organic catnip  
3. **Paw-ty Animals**: Felt lion manes, mouse-shaped confetti

**Avoid**: Balloons, loose glitter, or small plastic pieces.

### **Step 3: Guest List Etiquette**
- **Feline Friends**: Only invite cats your pet knows. Use scent-swapping towels first.  
- **Humans**: Limit to 5-6 calm adults. No toddlers or loud friends.

**DIY Invite Template**:  
> “You’re Invited to [Cat’s Name]’s 3rd Birthday!  
> **When**: [Date], 2-4 PM (Nap Time at 4:15!)  
> **Bring**: A toy for our donation drive (local shelter partnered).”
